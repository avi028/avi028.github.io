                        Have you ever wondered how your chrome or firefox or any other browsers grab the beautiful webpages 
                        from some remote servers? Well I did, and driven by curiosity, I rampaged the internet to find the 
                        big picture behind the servers. 

                        <div id="questions">

                        1. How did the servers transfered the html to browser?<br>
                        2. How the GET and POST methods worked ? <br>

                        I followed the tutorial and built my first http web server. It was a very simple server but it handled the static pages very well.<br> 
                        <strong style="font-size:20px">But</strong> 
                        <div id="questions">
                                3. How django and php changed the content of pages as per the user on the fly?<br>
                            .......<br>
                        </div>
                        I wanted images, videos and most importantly generating customised html pages from templates. 
                        And thus I started scaling my basic web server. I started writing parsers to extract info from  
                        url's and packets that was being received by the webserver. But then I was stuck on how to convert 
                        the html templates to pages with user info on the fly. and while searching for it I came aroudn the 
                        term <em>Reflection</em> , it is the ability of a programming language to look at its own code for variables and 
                        fuctions and get their value. Python has an access to a table filled with the variables defined in the code, but c++
                        doesnot not support Reflection and I was unable to find any library that could. So, I started to look for some hack to
                        get the value of the variables in the code. Then I discovred the beautiful concept of templates which are used for generic 
                        programming and that helped me to get a work around the Reflection. <br>
                        And finally on 12 July 2022 I pushed the c++ framework for dynamic pages in the <em>baby server 1.0</em>.   
                        In the upcoming blogs I will start discussing the baics of web server and Reflection and then a demo on hwo you can try it.
